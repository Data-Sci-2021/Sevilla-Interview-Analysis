## Progress report for Data Science Final Project - Angela 
**October 11, 2021** - Created Final Project repo, titled "Sevilla Interview Analysis". Added README.md, LICENSE.md and .gitignore files. Wrote updated plan in project_plan.md 

1. First Project Report- October 27, 2021
The main progress I have made up to this point has been transcription of my data. As of now, I have transcribed the speech of 8 interviews, though there are a total of 24. Each interview is broken into 5 questions, so I created 5 text files per speaker to allow for easier comparison across questions. One hurdle that I have encountered is that I underestimated the length of the interviews, as they are longer than I had originally thought. From the perspective of having a richer set of data, this is a good thing, but it also elongates the transcription process. Another challenge has been deciding how close of a transcription to conduct (whether or not to transcribe fillers, restarts, laughter, etc.). Since the focus is on the content for right now, I have not included utterance duplications such as restarts and reframes. If a speaker repeats themself for emphasis, this is included. In an ideal world, all 24 interviews will be transcribed, but I may use a subset of these data for time purposes. Finally, a wonderful friend who is a native speaker from Seville agreed to check my transcriptions for accuracy and provide a second opinion when necessary. 
- Regarding a sharing plan for the data, as of right now, I am just adding one interview transcript (which is comprised of 5 separate text files). I have decided not to share the sound files, as this data is more personal. I'll also be sharing the results of the frequency and keyword analyses, along with any other relevant excerpts. I have not yet decided whether or not to share all of the interview transcripts.
