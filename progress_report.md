## Progress report for Data Science Final Project - Angela 
**October 11, 2021** - Created Final Project repo, titled "Sevilla Interview Analysis". Added README.md, LICENSE.md and .gitignore files. Wrote updated plan in project_plan.md 

1. First Project Report- October 27, 2021
The main progress I have made up to this point has been transcription of my data. As of now, I have transcribed the speech of 8 interviews, though there are a total of 24. Each interview is broken into 5 questions, so I created 5 text files per speaker to allow for easier comparison across questions. One hurdle that I have encountered is that I underestimated the length of the interviews, as they are longer than I had originally thought. From the perspective of having a richer set of data, this is a good thing, but it also elongates the transcription process. Another challenge has been deciding how close of a transcription to conduct (whether or not to transcribe fillers, restarts, laughter, etc.). Since the focus is on the content for right now, I have not included utterance duplications such as restarts and reframes. If a speaker repeats themself for emphasis, this is included. In an ideal world, all 24 interviews will be transcribed, but I may use a subset of these data for time purposes. Finally, a wonderful friend who is a native speaker from Seville agreed to check my transcriptions for accuracy and provide a second opinion when necessary. 
- Regarding a sharing plan for the data, as of right now, I am just adding one interview transcript (which is comprised of 5 separate text files). I have decided not to share the sound files, as this data is more personal. I'll also be sharing the results of the frequency and keyword analyses, along with any other relevant excerpts. I have not yet decided whether or not to share all of the interview transcripts.  

2. Second Progress Report- November 20, 2021
Since the first progress report, I have completed the transcription of 22 sound files. This is the final data set for use in this analysis. In total, there are 110 txt files, since each speaker answered 5 different questions. The code for the data organization can be found in **Sevilla-Transcription.md** . 

- **found** subsection: 
Since the last progress report, I have organized the data into one data frame in RStudio. I then made the data tidy by dividing it into one word per row in order to do the frequency analyses. There are 6,187 words (rows) in the current data frame, which I can also turn into a tibble for the analysis phase. There are 5 columns total: line, word, participant (represented by the ID in the title, they are all random 3 digit numbers), question (1-5), and filename. My plan over the next week is to run the frequency analyses of the overall data frame with all questions, as well select each question and analyze the subsets individually to see what the most frequently used words are. One prediction I have is that the word "gracioso", or fun/funny, will be highly frequent in the Q3 subset. Almost every speaker mentioned that this was a comment they receive when traveling outside of Andaluc√≠a. I also have a data frame that has the sentences divided by line instead of by word, which will be used after the frequency analyses are completed. I can search for keywords and extract meaningful utterances from that data frame/tibble. 

- **license** subsection:
This part of the project is unfortunately limited, since I collected this data in 2019 and did not write any sort of description for how the data would be used into the exempt study script. For this reason, I cannot share the full data set, meaning both the transcriptions that I wrote or the original sound files. I have not yet included a license for this reason, since it is not really applicable to the current project.
