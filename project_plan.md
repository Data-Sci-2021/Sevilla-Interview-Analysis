## Angela Final Project: Sevilla Interview Analysis
October 11, 2021

-   **Summary**: I have some data from sociolinguistic interviews that I
    conducted in Spain in 2019 that have yet to be analyzed, and it
    will be useful to investigate while planning for my dissertation. The participants
    answered a few questions about their opinions of the varieties of
    Spanish spoken in Spain, and their experiences as speakers when they
    leave the south and travel to locations with more dialectal
    prestige, such as central Spain. I am interested in observing the
    qualitative trends of the data, since not all participants shared
    the same perspective.

-   **Data overview**: These data are very messy and I will have to
    first transcribe the interviews, as they are currently just .wav
    files. Luckily, the sound files are short (between 2-4 minutes), but if transcription takes too long, I will consider ASR options. There are around 20 speakers from Seville, Spain who participated in the interviews. The speakers verbally
    answered the following five questions, thus there are multiple
    responses associated with each participant. I have translated the
    questions to English for this proposal, but all of the data are in
    Spanish.

1.  Where are you from? Have you always lived in Spain?
2.  What is your opinion of the linguistic variety that exists within
    Andalusia?
3.  Have you traveled outside of Andalusia, but within Spain? When you
    leave the region, do you receive any comments about your accent?
4.  Is there representation of the Andalusian accent in the media,
    movies, etc.?
5.  Do you think that stereotypes about accents are changing now, or
    that they still remain?

I will also have to pull demographic information from other
spreadsheets to combine with the utterances.

-   **Data analysis**: I would like to do a keyword/frequency analysis to
    discover common themes about what is said, and then extract the
    exact utterances with those words. I'll also be working on this project in a Sociolinguistics class and am looking forward to analyzing the same data with two different perspectives- one looking at stance/identity of the speakers, and the other, helping me best locate and identify said perspectives! I will pay attention for common themes that arise while transcribing the data and will create a list of keywords to search for once the data are organized. Looking at word frequency will also help me identify which terms are most mentioned in the data set.
